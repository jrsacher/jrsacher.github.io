## Computational Thinking

### Building from the ground up

+ Binary
+ ASCII
+ Colors

### Core concepts

+ Abstraction
+ Pseudocode
+ Algorithms
  + Complexity of algorithms

### Dealing with data

+ Memory
+ Data structures
  + Arrays
  + Linked lists
  + Hash tables
+ Sorting
+ Searching

## Programming Languages

### Constructs

+ Variables: `x = 50`
+ Boolean expressions: `x < 100`
+ Conditionals: `if ... else if ... else`
+ Loops
  + `for` loops: repeat a set number of times
  + `while` loops: repeat while some Boolean expression is true
+ Functions
  + Reusable pieces of code that do a specific task

### Programming

+ Compiled languages
  + text --> compiler --> machine code
  + Generally better performing
+ Interpreted languages
  + text --> interpreter --> byte code --> virtual machine
  + Generally easier to work with, especially for prototyping


## Internet Technologies

### Protocols that make the internet work

+ DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
  + Assigns your device an _IP address_ (ex: 10.75.234.190)
+ DNS - Domain Name Service
  + Lookup service that can translate a domain name into an IP address 
  + "google.com" --> 172.217.12.132
+ TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
  + Used to move data between _routers_ with minimal loss
  + Data is divided into discrete _packets_
  + Uses _ports_ to identify the type of traffic
    + http: 80
    + https: 443
    + smtp: 587
+ UDP - User Datagram Protocol
  + Prioritizes speed at the expense of some data loss
  + Good for real-time applications
+ HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
  + Used to ask for and receive web pages
  + Envelope analogy for requests
    + Need both a recipient address and a return address (headers)
    + Data "inside" the envelope
  + Response codes can tell you what happened
    + 200: OK
    + 404: Not found

## Web Development

+ HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
  + Tells us what to display and some basics about how to do it
  + Uses _tags_ to do this
    + Tags use angle brackets: `<body>`
    + Tags (usually) need to be closed: `</body>`
  + Tags can have _attributes_
    + `class`
    + `id`

+ CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
  + Provides robust control over style, layout, formatting, etc.

+ JavaScript
  + Makes websites more interactive and responsive
