# Movie Ratings & Menu (Starter)
# Datasets:
#   - netflix_ratings.csv  (title,rating,service = Netflix)
#   - disney_ratings.tsv   (title,rating,service = Disney+)
# Concepts to practice: combining sources (rbind), menus (readline), escape characters, conditionals


# 1) Load both files, make sure data types make sense

# 2) Combine into one data frame (keep duplicates if title appears in both)

# 3) Add a 'quality' column via ifelse (>= 8.0 -> Highly Rated; else Average)

# 4) Build a simple text menu for unique titles and print info for the selected title
