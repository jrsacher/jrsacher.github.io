### Quiz questions

+ Describe the difference between a cable modem and a router, in the context of home networking.

A router (wireless or otherwise) connects your devices to the modem. The modem is responsible for sending/receiving information. The two are sometimes housed in the same unit. 

+ Identify two port numbers that are commonly used, and what services/protocols use them.

See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)) and links therein.

+ Why do we have multiple versions of the Internet Protocol?

We thought we had enough addresses for all the devices ever. It turns out we were wrong -- internet connected refrigerators weren't a thing when IPV4 was implemented.

### Quiz questions

+ How would we represent the number "28" in binary?

| 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

+ Describe at least one key difference between RAM and hard disk

RAM is faster at data transfer and has less storage capacity. A disk will maintain its state when power is removed, but RAM is _volatile_ -- it can't store anything without constant power.

+ What is an operating system? 

Software that sits between the user and hardware. Runs programs, manages resources, provides a user interface.
