  + Due Friday, 8/9 @ 11:59 PM ET
  + Like a normal assignment but longer, a few questions from each lecture
  + May have a review session and/or office hours before the exam
+ Questions?

#### **Questions from previous Sections**

+ Examples of cross-platform mobile apps?
  + The [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework uses the [Dart programming language](https://dart.dev/) to build unified apps. [Examples](https://flutter.dev/showcase) include Ebay, Toyota, and various Google apps.
  + The Xamarin framework lets you build platform-independent mobile apps using C#. [Examples from their site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/customers) include UPS, Alaska Airlines, and the American Cancer Society.
  + React Native lets you develop in JavaScript for both iOS and Android. [Some React apps include](https://reactnative.dev/showcase) things Facebook owns (can't believe I didn't think of that!) -- Facebook, Instagram and more; Tesla; Pinterest; Delivery.com; etc.
+ Are there database "frameworks?"
  + Not really "database frameworks," but there are [persistence frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_framework) that help applications communicate with databases.
  + [Object-relational mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) tools are [frameworks used *with* databases](https://www.killerphp.com/articles/what-are-orm-frameworks/), but not "database frameworks" themselves.

+ Questions?

#### Questions from Previous Years

+ _How do you know what protocol is being used?_
  + You can see all of your computer's internet connections by opening up a terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows) and running `netstat`. I was able to see a whole bunch of TCP and UDP connections and identify what some of them (but not all) were.
  + There may be ways to more directly see what's happening for a specific application, etc., but I don't know them
+ _DNS hijacking and HTTPS?_
  + It turns out security is only as good as its weakest link. If you're able to redirect traffic to your site _and_ get a valid certificate that says your site is "real," HTTPS won't protect you. ([Source](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/a-deep-dive-on-the-recent-widespread-dns-hijacking-attacks/))
  + In the Wikileaks case, their use of HTTPS Strict Transport Security provided a bit of added security, but didn't prevent the hack from occurring
  + People are coming up with new ways to make DNS more secure, such as [DNSSEC](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-security/), [encyption methods](https://www.opendns.com/about/innovations/dnscrypt/) and mores
+ _How are people exploiting internet-related vulnerabilities in the real world?_
  + DNS hijacking, as above and in the homework
  + [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting), which allows people to add their code to the code sent by legitimate websites
  + [CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY (CSRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery), where a user ends up sending a request that wasn't intended
  + [SQL injection attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) that gives an adversary access and/or modify information on your database.
  + General lack of security practices (unencrypted passwords, unsecured databases, human error exposing credentials, etc.)
  + **In the news**
    + [Equifax - 2017](https://www.cnet.com/news/equifaxs-hack-one-year-later-a-look-back-at-how-it-happened-and-whats-changed/): vulnerability in the server's software
    + [Facebook - 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/facebook-hack-data-breach.html): Security tokens
    + [US Government website - 2020](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/01/unpatched-us-government-website-gets-pwned-by-pro-iran-script-kiddie/): SQL injection
    + [Twitter - 2010](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/sep/21/twitter-bug-malicious-exploit-xss): XSS
    + [Facebook - 2019](https://latesthackingnews.com/2019/02/19/facebook-awarded-25000-bounty-for-reporting-a-csrf-vulnerability/): CSRF (identified before any known breach)
    + [Indian Government - 2019](https://latesthackingnews.com/2019/02/19/facebook-awarded-25000-bounty-for-reporting-a-csrf-vulnerability/): Unsecured database
  + David Malan on [security in general](https://youtu.be/QQmFyybzon0); Brian Yu with some [more in-depth details](https://youtu.be/bR1AZMk7SNs)
